- consider AUC-ROC to evaluate model. measures true-positive and false positive rates. i think this was covered in cs50
- also consider precision, recall, F1-score to evaluate model.
- choosing classification model:
	1. start with random forest - robust to overfitting. bit of a black box but that's not an issue here. tuning hyperparameters is important.
	2. depending on random forest results, consider neural network. possibly best in terms of performance but requires large resources, large datasets, and vulnerable to overfitting if not regularized properly.
